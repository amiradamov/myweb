# Portfolio Website

A responsive single-page portfolio with a hero portrait header and a vertical progress timeline to showcase milestones. The layout emphasizes gradient accents, roomy spacing, and approachable typography tailored for a product designer/developer profile.

## Getting Started
Open `index.html` in your browser to view the site. Styling lives in `styles.css`, and small interactions (timeline progress + contact form feedback) live in `script.js`.

## Customization
- Update text in `index.html` for your name and description.
- Swap the header portrait URL in the `<img>` tag or point it to your own asset.
- Adjust colors, spacing, or radii via the `:root` variables in `styles.css`.
- Edit the `experiences` array in `script.js` to paste your timeline items (year, headline, role, context, and bullet points).
- Update the snapshot stats, badges, or progress labels in the `timeline-summary` block inside `index.html`.
- Replace the contact form email link in the hero CTA with your preferred address.
