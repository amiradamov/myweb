# Portfolio Website

A modern, single-page portfolio layout featuring responsive grids, gradient accents, and a built-in light/dark theme toggle. Content is tailored for a creative developer/designer profile.

## Getting Started
Open `index.html` in your browser to view the site. The accompanying `styles.css` and `script.js` handle the visual system and small interactions.

## Customization
- Update text content directly in `index.html` to reflect your experience and projects.
- Adjust the color palette or typography in `styles.css` under the `:root` variables.
- Replace email links or social handles in the contact section with your own.
